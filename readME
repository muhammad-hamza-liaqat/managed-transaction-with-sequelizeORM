adding the foreign key between accounts and transections using old fashioned way

-- Alter the transactions table to add foreign key constraint for sender_account_number
ALTER TABLE transections
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_sender_account
FOREIGN KEY (sender_account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)
--ON DELETE CASCADE; -- This means that if an account is deleted, the corresponding transactions will also be deleted

-- Alter the transactions table to add foreign key constraint for receiver_account_number
ALTER TABLE transections
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_receiver_account
FOREIGN KEY (receiver_account_number) REFERENCES accounts(account_number)
--ON DELETE CASCADE; -- This means that if an account is deleted, the corresponding transactions will also be deleted
